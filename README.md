# pes-visualizer-equalizer
An audio spectrum visualizer on a STM3220G-EVAL evaluation board made in a project for programming of embedded systems.

We have implemented functions to transform the audio samples to the frequency domain using the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.  We also have an user interface with a graph that plots the frequency components.  The user can switch between different styles of graphs using the on-screen interface.



Sadly the equalizer part was never realized in this project.
